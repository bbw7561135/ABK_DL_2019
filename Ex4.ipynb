    "1. First we want to better understand the dataset. Plot (`plt.hist`) the distribution of each of the features for the training data as well as the 2D distribution (either `plt.scatter` or `plt.hist2d`) of each feature versus quality. Also calculate the correlation coefficient (`np.corrcoef`) for each feature with quality. Which feature is most predictive for the quality?\n",
